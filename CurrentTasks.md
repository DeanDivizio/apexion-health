# Currently working on
Implement proper types for gym vertical. 
- exercise
- session (this is probably fine as is but should be migrated to the new file in gymtypes.ts)

- gym session stats need to be stored locally - persistently - to guard against lost progress in the event of crash or accidental navigation
