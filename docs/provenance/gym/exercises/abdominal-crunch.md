## `abdominalCrunch` evidence

Defaults location: `lib/gym/exercises.ts`

### Base targets (rectus abdominis distribution)

- **Code pointer**: `abdominalCrunch.baseTargets`
- **What it supports**: Many EMG studies find limited ability to preferentially activate “upper” vs “lower” rectus abdominis with typical trunk-flexion exercises; both regions tend to co-activate strongly.
- **Sources**
  - Upper vs lower rectus EMG across trunk exercises: `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11319934/`
  - Rectus abdominis EMG during common curl-up/crunch variants: `https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2012/06000/electromyographic_activity_of_the_rectus_abdominis.18.aspx`
- **Confidence**: Medium.

### Bench angle

- **Code pointer**: `abdominalCrunch.variationEffects.planeAngle`
- **Notes**: Because evidence for reliable upper-vs-lower bias is limited, defaults keep angle effects neutral/conservative.
- **Confidence**: Low.
