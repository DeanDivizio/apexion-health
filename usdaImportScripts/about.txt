This folder contains the files needed to take a JSON copy of the branded and foundational foods databases from the UDSDA FoodData Central, strip away erroneous data, and put all values into a postgres database.

In a virtual python enviornment, install requirements.txt

Modify the files to point to and authenticate with your database. Make sure you adjust the path to your copy of the FDC data.

Run each of the files. The branded one will take a while.
